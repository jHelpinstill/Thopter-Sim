# Thopter-Sim
This program is a simulator for high frequency ornithopter blades, inspired by the new Dune movies. It is still in developement, and lacks a finished user interface at the moment. The comments are also sorely lacking, sorry about that (^_^;). I might keep updating this in the future, but also I might not!
